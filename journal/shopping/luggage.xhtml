      <a href="#luggage">Luggage</a>
    </h1>
    <p>This document highlights the factors you should consider while shopping for a new piece of luggage.</p>
    <h2 id="features" class="section">
      <a href="#features">Features</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Bags distinguish themselves via features such as <a href="#size">size</a>, <a href="#material">material</a>, <a href="#wheels">wheels</a>, and an <a href="#integrated-battery">integrated battery</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="size" class="section">
      <a href="#size">Size</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Due to the prevalence of air travel, bags are typically designed to fit into one of two size categories: <a href="#carry-on">carry-on</a> or <a href="#checked">checked</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="carry-on" class="section">
      <a href="#carry-on">Carry-on</a>
    </h4>
    <p>Carry-on bags are smaller so that they can fit in the overhead bins on most airplanes. For trips lasting a few days, you should try to pack your belongings in a carry-on bag so that it won&#39;t need to be checked. The advantages of using carry-on luggage include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoiding checked bag fees</li>
      <li>Saving the time required to check in the bag (5-30 minutes)</li>
      <li>Saving time at baggage claim at your destination (15 minutes)</li>
      <li>Having access to your items during the flight</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="checked" class="section">
      <a href="#checked">Checked</a>
    </h4>
    <p>Checked bags are larger, thus they must be stowed away in an airplane&#39;s luggage compartment. The added space affords you more room for your items. If you are preparing for a longer trip (i.e. more than 1 week) or need to carry specialty items (i.e. ski clothing), a larger bag may be a necessity. Just remember that the bag you choose will have to take a beating as it traverses airport baggage systems.</p>
    <h3 id="material" class="section">
      <a href="#material">Material</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Common materials used in the manufacture of luggage include cloth, plastic, and aluminum.</p>
    <h4 id="cloth" class="section">
      <a href="#cloth">Cloth</a>
    </h4>
    <p>Cloth bags are sturdy enough to last many plane flights. They come in all kinds of colors and patterns. They are also normally quite affordable. Heavy packers also benefit from their forgiving nature; you can stuff in a bit more if you just sit on it.</p>
    <p>Of course, cloth is especially vulnerable to the rigors of airport baggage systems. Over time, rips and scratches can render a cloth bag unusable, especially if it has to face rain, snow, or other natural forces. The seams where the cloth ties into the plastic exoskeleton or a zipper are another point of failure. </p>
    <h4 id="plastic" class="section">
      <a href="#plastic">Plastic</a>
    </h4>
    <p>Bags organized around a plastic (polycarbonate) structure are hardy. They can handle the blows they are surely to face in the luggage cabin of an airplane. They also come in any imaginable color or pattern. There are options at various price points, though generally they are somewhere between cloth and aluminum bags.</p>
    <p>While its durability can&#39;t be argued, plastic luggage will still show dings, dents, and scratches over time. The environmental impact of plastic should also be taken into account as you make your decision. If you are aware of the problems caused by plastics and want to reduce your reliance on them without sacrificing the durability they offer, you should consider aluminum luggage.</p>
    <h4 id="aluminum" class="section">
      <a href="#aluminum">Aluminum</a>
    </h4>
    <p>For over a century, aluminum has been a material of choice for high-end luggage due to its strength and malleability into classic designs. Of course, it comes at a cost. Aluminum luggage tends to be more expensive. It also shows wear and tear on its sleeve in a way that may be unfavorable to some eyes, though is a badge of pride to others. If you are motivated to avoid consuming plastics, aluminum luggage may be the choice for you. For more details about owning aluminum luggage, refer to these articles:</p>

    </ul>
    <h3 id="wheels" class="section">
      <a href="#wheels">Wheels</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Most bags either have two or four wheels. Most high-end luggage has settled on four wheels due to the additional degrees of freedom they provide when maneuvering. Additionally, when equipped with four wheels, a bag can roll on a flat surface without being dragged at an angle. Four wheels create a more elegant, effortless experience.</p>
    <h3 id="integrated-battery" class="section">
      <a href="#integrated-battery">Integrated battery</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Some carry-on bags distinguish themselves by integrating a battery so that you can charge your devices. While you may find this convenient, you should also be aware of some limitations. Specifically, certain airlines (i.e. Delta, United, etc.) prohibit you from keeping the battery installed in the suitcase during flight; for more information, refer to <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/battery">this document</a>. You may have to remove the battery and hold it while you are in the air. Luckily, most suitcases offering this feature design the battery to be easily removed should you still find it useful.</p>
    <p>Other factors which could impact your decision include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you already own another battery?</li>
      <li>Does the integrated battery have the ports you need?</li>
      <li>Do you want to tie yourself to those specific ports in case the technology world advances in the future?</li>
      <li>Do you want to deal with the hassle of removing the battery every time you get on a plane?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="brands" class="section">
      <a href="#brands">Brands</a>
    </h2>
    <p>While there are plenty of companies manufacturing luggage today, the brands below are great places to start your search.</p>
    <h3 id="away" class="section">
      <a href="#away">Away</a>
    </h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.awaytravel.com">Away</a> is a fairly new direct-to-consumer brand. Their suitcases are known for their tasteful designs and integrated battery packs. You may have even heard your favorite podcast advertising their products.</p>
    <p>The Away product lineup is clear and concise. You basically just need to make two decisions:</p>
    <ol class="arabic">
      <li>Size: Do you want a <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/shop/suitcases?size=carry-on">carry-on</a> or <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/shop/suitcases?size=checked">checked</a> suitcase?</li>
      <li>Material: Do you want a <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/shop/suitcases?material=nylon">nylon</a>, <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/shop/suitcases?material=polycarbonate">polycarbonate</a>, or <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/shop/suitcases?material=aluminum">aluminum</a> suitcase?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you choose a carry-on, you will need to decide whether to get the Carry-On or the Bigger Carry-On. <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/compare">This comparison</a> gives you all the necessary information to make that decision including: exact sizes, outfit capacity, and airline compatibility. Generally, most reviewers recommend purchasing the Bigger Carry-On since most large airlines don&#39;t specifically check carry-on bag sizes. If you will be flying on very small planes, you likely won&#39;t be able to have a carry-on of any size anyway.</p>

    <h3 id="rimowa" class="section">
      <a href="#rimowa">Rimowa</a>
    </h3>
    <p>With deep roots in the German aviation industry, <a href="https://www.rimowa.com">Rimowa</a> has resided in the luxury segment of the luggage industry for over a century. Its <a href="https://www.rimowa.com/us/en/all-luggage/">suitcases</a> are renowned for their quality craftsmanship but also their price. The iconic design aesthetic of Rimowa is sure to signal your appreciation of quality. Though, in recent years, new brands (i.e. Away and Arlo Skye) have been disrupting Rimowa&#39;s preeminence by offering products of similar quality for half the price by selling directly to consumers via the Internet. Perhaps that century of focus still yields a superior product, but does the gap contain something you&#39;ll notice?</p>
    <p>The Rimowa product lineup includes a few different collections with distinct styles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.rimowa.com/us/en/classic/">Classic</a>: A more traditional aluminum style with leather handles; it exudes <em>luxury</em>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.rimowa.com/us/en/original/">Original</a>: A more modern take on the Classic suitcase akin to the aluminum Away suitcases.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.rimowa.com/us/en/essential/">Essential</a>: The classic Rimowa style in polycarbonate instead of aluminum.</li>

    <h3 id="arlo-skye" class="section">
      <a href="#arlo-skye">Arlo Skye</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Arlo Skye is another recent direct-to-consumer entrant into the suitcase market bearing some similarity to Away. If you want a slightly more fashion-forward alternative to Away, their bags may fit the bill. With leather handles and a distinctive style, they add a bit of flair to the Away formula without altering the price points drastically. In particular, you may find <a href="https://arloskye.com/collections/all-products/products/the-frame-carry-on-max-aluminum-edition">the Frame Carry-On Max: Aluminum Edition</a> to be an interesting comparison.</p>
    <p>If you are cross-shopping with Away, you should keep in mind the ecosystems of the respective products. Arlo Skye has a much more limited product lineup currently; it lacks multiple checked bag sizes, trunks, children&#39;s suitcases, and more. It also doesn&#39;t have first-party accessories that fit nicely into its bags.</p>
    <h3 id="others" class="section">
      <a href="#others">Others</a>

    <p>The list of brands above is obviously not comprehensive. This section attempts to oversimplify some of the competition to help you understand the market&#39;s breadth without losing focus from the most interesting competitors.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="decision" class="section">
      <a href="#decision">Decision</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Whatever choice you make, I hope this article has proven useful in your research. For transparency and my own future reference, I will now share the decision I reached and some minor details about my thought process.</p>
    <p>Having previously heard of Away on various podcasts, I was inclined to immediately purchase from that brand. However, when I observed the breadth of their product lineup, I realized that I really didn&#39;t understand the differentiation in the market. This led to this research expedition.</p>
    <p>I knew I wanted a hard-shell suitcase since my previous cloth suitcase had begun to fall apart after years of reliability. I first dug into the differences between polycarbonate and aluminum suitcases. Given my aversion to consuming plastics when I can avoid it, I veered into the land of aluminum suitcases. I worried about the aesthetics of a battered aluminum suitcase vs. a battered polycarbonate suitcase, but concluded that both would cause me anxiety in roughly equal measure. At least with aluminum, I would be able to avoid consuming excess plastic.</p>
    <p>The primary brands I considered thus shifted to Rimowa and Away (Arlo Skye was a distant third). I nearly settled on Rimowa since I appreciate well-designed products, but the differences seemed a bit too obscure to justify the price difference to me. The primary differences I could discern were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The handle clamping speed: Rimowa handles spring back sharply. Away handles gently shut. I slightly prefer the gentle close.</li>
      <li>The direction of the lines on the case: Rimowa cases are distinguished by their vertical lines which look refined and timeless when the suitcase is standing and stationary. Away cases use horizontal lines which are similarly distinctive, though less obviously <em>elegant</em>. Instead, they communicate an egalitarian quality and horizontal motion, as if the suitcase is meant to be rolling. In the end, the direction of the lines sank in priority compared to their respective z-axes. I preferred the concavity of Away&#39;s design since it seemed less likely that scratches or dents would render the ridges an eyesore.</li>
      <li>The handle stop stages: Rimowa&#39;s handle is stage-free. Away&#39;s seems to be tiered. Though I prefer the idea of the stage-free design, this seems like a fairly minor detail.</li>
      <li>The wheel caps: Rimowa&#39;s wheels have holes. Away&#39;s are solid. The look of Rimowa&#39;s is more impactful, but in practice, I suspect rolling over gravelly surfaces would cause me anxiety that rocks may nestle inside the holes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If anything, Away&#39;s design decisions seemed to be giving it the edge despite its lower price. Obviously, it would be convenient to assess build quality in-person, but the scale was beginning to tip based on images alone.</p>
    <p>I was primarily cross-shopping <a href="https://www.rimowa.com/us/en/luggage/colour/silver/cabin-plus/92556004.html">the Rimowa Original Cabin Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/suitcases/aluminum-bigger-carry-on">the Away Bigger Carry-On: Aluminum Edition</a>. Though I kept an eye on the brands&#39; entire product lineups since I expect I&#39;ll need a matching checked suitcase at some point, I only need a carry-on currently.</p>
    <p>As Away pulled ahead, I needed to make a final decision on the color. While my usual preference for black was pulling me in that direction, I worried that scratches would show through to the underlying metal more prevalently than silver. Based on some long-term reviews I watched on YouTube, this suspicion seemed to be confirmed. I chose silver to hopefully avoid feeling too much anxiety after a few trips.</p>
    <p>Finally, I chose to leave out the integrated battery since I intend to fly with United Airlines frequently in the future and they would require the battery to be removed. It seemed like too much of a hassle. Additionally, all the ports seem to be USB-A ports; since I&#39;m mostly transitioned to USB-C already, I would have to carry duplicate wires.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, I purchased <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/suitcases/aluminum-bigger-carry-on">the Away Bigger Carry-On: Aluminum Edition</a> in silver without a USB charger.</p>
